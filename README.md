### Environmental Waste Hotspot Analysis — Urban Nigerian Communities

> *Predicting where Nigeria's urban waste management system is failing, why it is failing, and what to do about it.*

---

## The Problem

Urban waste mismanagement in Nigeria is a compounding crisis. Illegal dumping blocks drainage channels. Blocked drainage causes flooding. Flooding spreads waste further and blocks more drainage. Decision-makers lack a data-driven way to identify which communities need intervention first — and which interventions will actually work.

EcoTrack AI addresses that gap.

## What This Project Does

This project analyses **1,000 urban communities across 12 Nigerian states** using a weighted risk scoring model built on four environmental indicators. It identifies which communities are in crisis, which are heading there, and where targeted investment will produce the greatest impact.

**Tools used:** Python · Microsoft Excel · Power BI · DAX

## Key Findings

**🔴 149 communities are in Critical condition** — and 33% of them are in a single state (Borno), despite Borno representing only 7.6% of all communities analysed.

**🟠 75.2% of all communities are active dumping hotspots** — but not all hotspots are equal. 136 of them are structural hotspots driven by distance from disposal sites, not behavioural failure. Enforcement campaigns will not fix these. Infrastructure access will.

**🟡 106 high-risk communities generate over 15 tons of waste monthly but receive collection only once per week.** Increasing frequency to twice per week is associated with a 35% reduction in illegal dumping — the single highest-return intervention in this dataset, requiring no new infrastructure.

**🟢 Infrastructure quality (r = -0.81) and collection frequency (r = -0.64) are the two strongest predictors of low risk** — more than awareness, economic status, or population density combined.

## What Makes This Project Different

### The Recalibration Decision
The original risk classification flagged **841 of 1,000 communities (84.1%) as High Risk** — a number so large it communicates nothing actionable. A policymaker cannot prioritise 841 equally-weighted communities.

I identified this as a calibration failure and rebuilt the classification using a **percentile-based four-tier model**:

| Tier | Threshold | Communities | % of Dataset |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Low | ≤ 33rd percentile | 330 | 33% |
| 🟡 Medium | ≤ 66th percentile | 330 | 33% |
| 🟠 High | ≤ 85th percentile | 190 | 19% |
| 🔴 Critical | > 85th percentile | 150 | 15% |

The original columns were kept and renamed (not deleted) as an audit trail — because the recalibration story is itself worth showing.

### The Dashboard Design
The Power BI dashboard uses a **clean corporate environmental palette** — soft white canvas, forest green headers, muted risk tier colours — designed specifically for government and NGO stakeholders, not a tech audience. Every colour decision is intentional and documented.

## Risk Scoring Methodology

```
Risk Score = (0.35 × Dumping) + (0.25 × Drainage) + (0.25 × Flood) + (0.15 × Complaints)
```

All four inputs are **min-max normalised** before weighting — converting each variable to a 0–1 scale so no column dominates due to its raw numeric range.
